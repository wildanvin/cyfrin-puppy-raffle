In the password store project Patrick did somehting cool with chatGPT and it reviewed the markdown, maybe check it again

### [S-#] `PuppyRaffle:enterRaffle` function can be called with an empty array causing underflow

`PuppyRaffle:enterRaffle` function can be called with an empty array. In the functionality to check for duplicates it will underflow the expression `players.length - 1` making it `2^256-1`. This will cause the first for loop to run 2^256 times.

**Description:**
`PuppyRaffle:enterRaffle` function can be called with an empty array. In the functionality to check for duplicates it will underflow the expression `players.length - 1` making it `2^256-1`. This will cause the first for loop to run 2^256 times.

**Impact:**
The contract can be bricked if you pass as input the empty array, it will cost a lot of gas but in very cheap blockchains maybe it can be done

**Proof of Concept:**

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Sanitize input data for the contract, so the empty array can not be passed as input

### [S-#] Casting of the fee variable from uint256 to unit64 can result in not getting all the fee from the contract

**Description:**
When the fee is greater than 2^64-1, it wont be able to receive it because the raffle will think that the game is still on potentially bricking the contract

**Impact:**
The fee wont be received completely
The contract can be bricked or a DOS can happen

**Proof of Concept:**

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Use a bigger uint

### Not following CEI pattern will cause reentrancy in the PuppyRaffle:refund function causing loss of funds

**Description:**
Not following the Check-Effects-Interactions in the PuppyRaffle:refund function will cause the lost of funds if one of the players is a malicious contract.
**Impact:**

**Proof of Concept:**

**Recommended Mitigation:**

### [S-#] Failing to send ether to the winner will brick the contract

**Description:**
If the winner of the raffle is a contract that can not receive ether the contract will be bricked

**Impact:**
The contract will be bricked

**Proof of Concept:**

**Recommended Mitigation:**
For sending money use a pull over push approach. Make the user pull the money from the contract instead of the contract pushing the money to the winner

### [S-#] Unbounded array will cause DoS

**Description:**
The players array can grow indefinitely making it harder for new players to participate in the raffle. It can brick the contract if it reaches tha block gas limit.

**Impact:**
DoS, will be more expensive to new players to enter the game. A malicious player can register himself a lot of times to have more chances to win the raffle and make it harder for new player to participate

**Proof of Concept:**

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Use other method to check for duplicates, use a mappig.
