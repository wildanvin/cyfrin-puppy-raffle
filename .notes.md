solidity 0.7.x -> possible over/underflow

In the password store project Patrick did somehting cool with chatGPT and it reviewed the markdown, maybe check it again

if you enter a new array of players the old players wont be able to get the refund

### [S-#] `PuppyRaffle:enterRaffle` function can be called with an empty array

`PuppyRaffle:enterRaffle` function can be called with an empty array. In the functionality to check for duplicates it will underflow the expression `players.length - 1` making it `2^256-1`. This will cause the first for loop to run 2^256 times.

**Impact:**
The contract can be bricked if you pass as input the empty array, it will cost a lot of gas but in very cheap blockchains maybe it can be done

**Proof of Concept:**

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Sanitize input data for the contract, so the empty array can not be passed as input

### [S-#] Casting of the fee variable from uint256 to unit64 can result in not getting all the fee from the contract

**Description:**
When the fee is greater than 2^64-1, it wont be able to receive it because the raffle will think that the game is still on potentially bricking the contract

**Impact:**
The fee wont be received completely
The contract can be bricked or a DOS can happen

**Proof of Concept:**

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Use a bigger uint

/\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***/
